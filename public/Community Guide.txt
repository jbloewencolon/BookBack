Contributing to BookBack

BookBack is a tool for the commons, built by the commons. We rely on community submissions to make the "Auto-Detect" feature work for tricky library websites (like NYPL, Chicago Public Library, etc.).

How to Add Your Library

If BookBack isn't auto-detecting your library, we probably need to add it to our Known Domains Map.

Option 1: The Easy Way (Open an Issue)

Go to the "Issues" tab on this GitHub repository.

Create a New Issue titled: Add [Library Name]

Provide the following two pieces of information:

Library Homepage: (e.g., https://example-library.org)

Search Result URL: Perform a search for "test" on your library's catalog and paste the resulting URL here.

Option 2: The Developer Way (Pull Request)

If you know your way around code, you can add it directly!

Open options.js.

Locate the KNOWN_DOMAINS object at the top of the file.

Add your library's homepage (clean domain) and the search pattern.

Replace the search term with {{query}}.

Example:

const KNOWN_DOMAINS = {
    'nypl.org': '[https://borrow.nypl.org/search?query=](https://borrow.nypl.org/search?query=){{query}}&searchType=everything',
    'mylibrary.org': '[https://catalog.mylibrary.org/find?q=](https://catalog.mylibrary.org/find?q=){{query}}' // Your addition
};


Submit a Pull Request!

Why isn't this automatic?

We prioritize privacy. BookBack does not have a central server or database. It lives entirely on your device. This means we cannot "cloud update" the list; the community must curate the list together in the code itself.

Pull requests are welcome. Areas where contributions are especially appreciated:

Additional retailer support

Robust ISBN parsing

International library template presets

Accessibility upgrades

New UI themes
