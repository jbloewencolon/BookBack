# Privacy Policy for BookBack

_Last updated: [Insert Date]_

BookBack is designed with a privacy-first philosophy. The extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data beyond what is necessary for its core functionality. BookBack exists to help users reconnect with public libraries, not to track or profile them.

## 1. Information We Collect

### **No Personal Data Collection**
BookBack does **not** collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal identifiers  
- Browsing history  
- Page content  
- IP addresses  
- Click behavior  
- Analytics data  
- Advertising data  
- Any form of telemetry  

We do not use remote servers, third-party trackers, analytics scripts, or cookies.

### **Local Storage Only**
The only data stored by BookBack lives **entirely on your device** using Chrome's `storage.local` API:

- **Library templates** that you manually create in the Options page  

This data never leaves your machine and is not transmitted anywhere.

## 2. How Data Is Used

The library templates you save are used **only** to construct search URLs when you click the “Borrow It” button. This happens locally in your browser.  
No data is harvested, analyzed, or shared.

## 5. External Links

When you click “Borrow It,” BookBack opens new tabs pointed at:

- DuckDuckGo maps (only when using the "Find Library" fallback)

These URLs are constructed locally and opened directly in your browser.  
BookBack does not modify, monitor, or track your interactions with those sites.
